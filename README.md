### Adaptive-Concept-Learning-in-Honey-Bees
Abstract: Learning is one of the most essential skills for an organism even if it is at a very low level. It facilitates foraging, communication, adaptivity, and the overall survival of the organism. It is important to understand the inner workings of the learning mechanism to increase its efficiency. A plethora of ongoing research dating back to the 1900s has helped shed some light on the empirical front of learning in animals. In this report, I study the empirical results of concept learning and adaptivity in honey bees and propose a biologically inspired spiking neuronal model of the mushroom body in their brain to fit the data. The model is based on the equations proposed by Sir Alan Hodgkin and Sir Andrew Huxley that are regarded as the most accurate depiction of spiking neurons. Studying spiking neurons through modelling or simulation is very important as they are the basis of a biological neural network and it will help provide a deeper understanding of the inner mechanism of learning. The bee model is able to learn the concept of similarity/difference presented as stimuli and adaptively perform optimally on novel stimuli without re-learning it.
